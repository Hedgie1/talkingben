# Talking Ben Discord Bot

Talking Ben is my opensource Discord Bot inspired by a game Talking Ben.
Bot is running on discord.js v13 version.

# Tutorial
- Create a bot using the [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) website.
- Download the ZIP file of this repo from `Releases` page and unzip it.
- Run the `installation.bat` file.
- After installing, edit the `config.json` file with your bot token and status you want to have on your bot.
- Run the bot using `run.bat` file!
- Invite the bot using this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot
⬆️⬆️⬆️ Edit the CLIENT_ID with your bot's ID. (Can be found on the Discord Developers page)

## YOUR NODE.JS VERSION MUST BE ABOVE V16! OTHERWISE THE BOT WILL NOT WORK!
